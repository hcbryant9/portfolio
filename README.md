This is a for of Steven Leabo's 'Shadow Stack' web developer portfolio built with Astro. Currently hosted with Firebase & GitHub Actions, feel free to fork this one or the original.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

**Clone the repository.**
**Install the dependencies.**

```bash
npm install
```

**Start the development server.**

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Start editing the code!**

Start with src/layouts/Layout.astro to set site description, title, and URL above the markup. Then start building out components for work and projects in `src/components/` and pages in `src/pages/`. Use the ones I left as a starting point. Make sure to update your social links in `src/components/Social.astro` and provide a [https://formspree.io/](https://formspree.io/) URL in `src/components/Contact.astro`. Most of the rest of the information lives on `src/pages/index.astro`.
