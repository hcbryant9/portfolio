      Web-based game inspired by the board game Hues & Cues by Scott Brady with daily colors and hints.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="text-white">The site was built using React & Firebase throughout the course of a couple months. The image above is the developer mode created as a GUI for my collaborator,
          <a href="https://www.thenameist.com/" class="underline inline">The Nameist</a>, who could add secret colors and clues to the database. Each time the link is visited the database is queried for the entry with the current date.
          The database is firebase's NoSQL databse 'Firestore'. Firebase is also used for the continuous deployment of the application.
          The colors on the board were generated by a Python script I created for future board changing.
          It was largely inspired by Daily New York Times games such as Wordle and the Mini Cross. The user is prompted with 2 seperate hints where they can guess to get
          closest to the secret color. They can share their results with their friends to see who can get closest.
